# What is (seriously) wrong with SVNIT?

This blog is a **letter** to the student communtiy of SVNIT. In August 2020, I will complete 3 years in college. While in general, my experience with college life has been good, I am not completely satisfied with it either. Before anyone starts reading, I would like to emphasize that this isn’t a rant on college administration or system or professors. In fact, it is the opposite. I would like to discuss certain things which most of us do not even consider or think. The problem with the **student community of SVNIT**. This is going to be a bit **long**, for those who are busy can directly read the concluding points I made in the **Crux** section.

Most of the Indian **Science** and **Engineering** aspirants have pretty high expectations from college life. In fact, that is the reason why they prepare so hard to get into a college like ours. While we all are infatuated with the IITs (for the right reasons of course), somewhere we forget that most of the students of our campus were in the top **99th percentile** of the entire country when they’d given the university entrance exams. Take a moment and ponder over that figure. Statistically speaking, and arguably, we are some of the **brightest** minds in the country. What do you expect from such a community of engineering aspirants? I will share mine. 

Before I joined college, in the month of Aug. 2017, I thought an engineering college will be all about engineering, science and technology. That most of the times, I’ll be working on some **cutting edge algorithm, robotics, self-driving vehicles**. And that the only discussions we have will be about how the **theory of everything** is possible or not, what is the logic behind **quantum computing**, why is the current government policy right/wrong on an **economic front**, how we can deploy **mathematical models** to tackle the volatile **market fluctuations**. This brings me to my first issue with the student community. 

## Technology? Engineering solutions? What are our priorities?

This is not a personal target or an attack on anyone. I am just putting out my opinion with a tone of critique, and when you try to criticize someone, you might end up hurting them. Well, this is not at all my motive, but I am going forward with **healthy criticism**. What are our **priorities**? We are National Institute of Technology. **Technology**. We aren’t an arts college. We aren’t an acting school. We aren’t a singing school. And yet I have realised that the priorities of us as a community has been art, music, dance, theatre, etc. While I have no issues with anyone’s interest in art, I myself am interested in analysing music, and films all the time. My emphasis is on the word priority. Why are we here in an institute of Technology? According to me, we are here to **solve problems**, to find **engineering solutions**, to discuss flaws/advantage in a certain technology, to improve it. Even if not for social good, we are here to satisfy our love for science and engineering we had since high school. 

I feel sad when the **non-technical clubs - dance, art, photography, singing, etc** - experience more **student enthusiasm** than some of the finest technology events - **robotics programs, winter schools, tech talks, etc**. 
I feel sad when the non-technical clubs earn thrice as much **college funds** as some of the technology clubs. This is sad because a lot of tech-clubs are enthusiastic about organizing events but could not because the funds were limited. In fact, some of my friends have conducted events out of their own pockets just so that they could try to spread their dream of the tech-savvy environment in our college. I have seen **empty hostels** during some of these non-technical evening events. However, when some of the best of SVNIT’s **researchers and professors** had tried to give some wonderful talks, very few were excited. 
This brings us to another important point. College **placements**. 

## Reason for poor placements. Maybe us?

Everyone would agree that placements are a function of **college reputation** (maybe in the form of rankings, research work, etc) and the efforts of the placement committee in creating **valuable contacts** in the industry. This is true and it is also true that we aren’t good at both these factors. However, there is a third variable involved which according to me, is equally or even more important than the other. **Students’ skills** and **accomplishments**. A company would hire anyone not because they are from a particular college, but because they have the exact skills which are required by them. Imagine a college community where a majority of the students are aware of the concepts of algorithmic trading, mathematical finance, financial analysis and most of them have applied these skills to real market conditions. Why wouldn’t a company approach such a college instead of going to a community which is fairly smart but not aware of any of these concepts? Well, this is why some of the major **Investment Banks**, **Hedge Funds**, **Big Auditing Firms** approach some top **NITs, all BITS** and **old IITs**. I am in contact with a lot of students as well as student chapters of some of these universities and I am amazed to see how all of them have one thing in common - **right priorities**. A tech-savvy environment where everyone is excited to skill themselves up according to what is **required by the industry**. While we are busy in activities like art, music, festival, community dance, etc, students in other colleges are busy with their industry-compatible talks, events, skill-up programs. Again, I am not saying that other colleges do not have these non-tech events, in fact, they have some of the best cultural fests in the country. But it is all about priorities. They have their priorities in the **right place**. 


## The issue with the techncal student clubs

If anyone is to blame for this serious lacking of tech-savvy environment, it will be the **tech clubs** of the college and their **core leadership**. Currently, the goal of these tech clubs is to attract those who are **already interested** in engineering. With this attitude, they cannot call themselves tech communities. They are meant for a few **‘elite’** who were privileged enough in their lives to have attended the schools and live with people who were fairly techy and so they developed an interest in it. What about the others? Those who have tremendous capabilities of engaging in technology, however, are left behind just because they aren’t aware of these programs because student groups did not keep them completely **open**. What do I mean by **open** here? 

Obviously these programs are open for every SVNITian. However, there is a serious issue with their approach. Most of them are - if interested in robotics join us, if interested in finance join us, if interested in coding join us, if interested in software join us, if interested in automobiles join us. What they should essentially be doing is - join us where we all will explore finance, automobile, coding, development (or whatever the specialization of the group is) and then you can assess if this interests you. There is a **subtle difference** between the two approaches. Former brings together (mostly) those who have already **made their minds up** on what engineering field they are interested in and **leaving behind others**, while the latter invites everyone to **explore** groups’ activities and then decide for themselves which engineering field suits best for their interests. The latter is a truly **OPEN approach** to student chapters and groups.

Another issue with these tech clubs is that a **humungous** amount of funds are utilized in participating year after year in the same **competitions**. They work as if these competitions are their final **annual goals** and everything else is secondary. Students are scrutinized so heavily during their induction into these groups because the group’s sole motto is **“Win the championship”**. This leaves behind those who might have had the potential but they were rejected just because they could not prove it at the moment. I am not against participating in competitions. In fact, I am proud that a lot of our student groups have won at national level championships and improved our college’s brand value. However, they somehow derail from their important goal - **Promote science** on campus. We need to change this and be more **accepting**, more **popular**, and more **active** among the student community in order to promote science and technology on campus. 

**Departmental clubs**. I do not know where to begin. Honestly, they are so **incompetent** that they receive the largest funds from administration and all they do is spend that money on just **3-4 days of good for nothing events** in their so-called “departmental weeks”. Many of their events are so **stupid** that, in reality, they act as **demoters of Science**. They have mostly **repetitive events** which they organize every year without any change, with large crowd from local **GTU colleges** which are there just for the **certificate credits** offered by their colleges! To be honest, a software or programming workshop where you are simply taught certain software and programming languages are **no**t “Promoters of science”. If one really wants to promote their fields of engineering, they should bring in experts from industry discuss real problem solving like - **Why Burj Khalifa is tapered in structure, how is its foundation sustainable, what are challenges to blockchain aided decentralized electricity distribution, how to achieve solar potential, how to use python to solve our transportation issues**. If asked my opinion, we should completely do away with the **fund hogging** department clubs because most of them aren’t even close to how a technology community should operate. Lastly, I come to the most important pillar of any university in the industry. **Alumni**.

## Unhelpful Alumni. 

The most important goal of a college pass out should be to **give back** to their juniors. This can be done by regularly contacting with the student community, **mentoring** them, helping them with **financial support** or improving college’s **reputation** within the corporate world. I see nothing of that sort in SVNIT. Nothing. Alumni are so indifferent to their own alma mater that one might question - Did you really graduate from this college? I have seen these successful large “package” winners in the placement, quit their tech groups because now their work is done. They got the job. No need to indulge in tech events now. No need to “lead” the groups to promote technology, which they were the biggest proponent of, earlier. A common characteristic in some of the best T and B-Schools in the country is their alumni support. A few B-Schools get their reputation and good placements just because they have their alumni in some of the best positions in the corporate world. IITB alumni are so generous that in 2018 they donated somewhere around 20 crores to their alma mater. The selfish position of our alumni is **saddening**. 

## Crux 

1. Student community needs to set the priorities right. Indulge actively in technical activities which will help them improve their skills
2. It is more important to make the student community as a whole more skilled. It’s only then we can have better placements.
3. Tech clubs should be more engaging and lenient in scrutinizing viable candidates. They should focus more on developing an engineering environment on campus instead of planning for the same competitions year after year.
4. Departmental clubs are seriously incompetent. They need complete bottom-up transformation in their structure. Their events should be spread more across the year, and their leaders should focus on improving their events.
5. We need more support from our alumni. But since it is their choice, I emphasize on the future generation of college alumni to focus on having better communication and help post-college.
6. Seniors are banned from contacting (officially) the freshers in 1st semester. While I understand the need for this protection, we should also see that this rule keeps seniors and juniors away for almost 3-4 months which otherwise could have been used by our tech clubs to inculcate interests among freshers.


## Final words

I did not want to publish this blog on medium or other blogging platforms because this might seriously tarnish our reputation in the market. One of our professors once said in his class - IIM-A is the best B-School in India. But it isn’t perfect. Students **regularly criticize** so as to improve it on all fronts. However they are so secretive and internal in doing that, they do not tarnish the reputation of IIM-A in the market.

This blog is a **letter** to the current tech group **leadership** to improve their functioning and increase their reach on campus. This is a letter to my **juniors** on why it is so necessary to set your priorities right. I seriously apologize if I have hurt someone, but honestly, I wanted to talk about this for a year or so. 
I hope I am successful in sparking interests in the bright young minds we have on campus.
