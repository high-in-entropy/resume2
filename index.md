Hi! I am a junior year undergrad from **National Institute of Techology, Surat**. Highly oriented, to-the-point individual who has an expireience of managing small to super big events, a team of more than 50 students, and mentoring directly a group of 20-24 highly motivated individuals in the field of Finance, Business Development and Entrepreneurship at my college level. An avid reader following likes of **Salman Rushdie**, **Ayn Rand**, **Nassim Nicholas Taleb**. I was highly motivated by the works of **Albert Einstein** as a high school grad who taught me how imagination, perseverance and logic when combined can help mankind achieve great things. Since I have an ardent passion for the world of finance, I am a regular follower of Robert Shiller and Ray Dalio. When I am not reading, programming or working, I love to travel. I love to connect to local people, know about their traditions and culture whenever I visit some place. Dream is to travel all around the world until I turn 30!
