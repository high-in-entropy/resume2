# God is a Mathematical equation.

Since I attained the spirit of individual thinking and opinion, I have always been an **atheist**. My first thought (when I was probably 14)
was I did not want to blame others for my failures. The worst thing about a religious person that I’d noticed at that point of time was 
that people always put the blame of their failures on some supernatural, invisible, powerful character called god. However, over years 
I have arrived at a **finer understanding** of what god is/might be. I am a science person, in the sense that, I have beliefs only in 
**postulates**, **mathematical proofs** or **empirical equations**. Extrapolating that to my **philosophical ideologies**, I have a very **noisy belief** 
of **god**. Yes, I am an atheist because I do not believe in **traditional understandings** of God. However, I do **believe** in a god-like power. 
I do not know if that qualifies as a characteristic of an atheist, I leave that for you to decide. In the next few paragraphs, I’ll 
explain what god means to me. 




# Why the universe cannot be god-less? 

---

Whenever someone asks me this question, I answer them with a simple explanation. **Birth of universe itself**. While the **Big Bang theory** is
widely accepted as the origin of the universe, and for many religious people, the fact that there was a **singularity** out of nowhere at
**t = 0** points to a god, my reason for god’s existence comes from **post-BigBang events**. I am not a physics major, so may not be able to 
explain the exact events after BigBang in detail however I will try my best. 

After the **supermassive explosion** of a point heavy mass **singularity**, the humungous energy of this explosion was converted into mass by 
Einstein’s famous **energy-mass equation**. The explosion itself was so energetic that the microseconds old baby-universe started to **expand** 
away from the point of explosion, and many believe it is still expanding. The perfect heat and mass when combined started forming the 
natural elements of the periodic table. Within **3 minutes of BigBang**, **Hydrogen** and **Helium** were formed. The energy and mass formed 
electrons, protons, and other fundamental elements. When electrons received the perfect energy to be bound with newly formed nuclei, 
hydrogen and helium were born. However, the energy of the system was so massive that it was **impossible** to maintain that state and 
**disfavoured** further formation of elements. It was only after about **380,000 years** or so, that the universe expanded and cooled enough 
for **heavy elements** to form. Fast forward, huge masses of **celestial bodies** were formed. Somehow these massive bodies possessed the 
exact **orbital velocities** required by them to circle around a central body forming various systems. Many **collided** with other orbital 
members however somehow some survived and kept on revolving till eternity. We come to **earth**. Originally earth had **non-living compounds**
like **proteins**, etc. Somehow the conditions were suitable for the rain to occur and these non-living compounds to turn into **living 
organisms**! Fast forward, with constant evolution we today have complex environmental systems and living organisms. Just look at the
human body. Most of our organs, especially brain, are not completely researched. The brain is such a beautifully complex system of
neural networks. The fact that small volts of electric currents govern our entire body - **thoughts** and **metabolism** just amazes me. Nature
itself is so beautiful and complex. 

What was the **probability** of such complex systems to form out of **point mass**?! Just imagine if the universe hadn’t cooled enough for elements beyond
helium to form. We **delete** the entire **possibility** of current universe and certainly the complex systems of the earth. Just one
event in these billions of years-long chain of events altered, the entire system **collapses**. If we were super-brainy organisms who had
explored all the possibilities of universe formation and plotted these events with their probability densities, I am sure the current
set of events would definitely be **3-3.5 standard deviations** away from the **most probable set of events**. What is the probability that
this was successful? Here is where I **HAVE** to believe the presence of some **natural superpower** which governed the entire process of 
universe formation right from the beginning. Somehow it made sure that these chain of events **occurred perfectly** when they were meant
to. 




# The mathematical equation

---

Just like our understanding of **universe** is governed by **laws of physics**, the supernatural power I just proved is, according to me,
governed by a **set of equations** and conditions. A general belief of almost all the **religions** mankind has ever followed is that god
is some person who has the **power to control** the universe. An inherent **condition** in all these religions is that we as an individual and
a society should always be looking forward to doing **good deeds** so that we remain in the **“good books”** of this **powerful person**, God. This
is evident by **heaven** and **hell** visualizations of almost all the religions. And this is where I **depart** from general religious people.
Henceforth I will refer to my ideology of god as **“the power”** so as to differentiate it from general belief of **“God”**.

Looking at the **injustice**, **class differences**, past **horrors** of humanity, I cannot believe that the power is something which **rewards good**
deeds and **punishes evil**. In fact, if it were so active and passionate about favouring the good, why did the **bad arrive** in the first
place? How can the power favour something like **slavery**? How can it favour the horror of the **Holocaust**? Which always gives me the chills
if I even think about it. How can it make good people’s lives so **miserable** and make the evil ultra-powerful so **successful**?  How can
**senseless terrorism** still exist? Had there been **“God”** such systems would definitely have been cleaned by the **force of doing good**.
However, that is **not** at all the case.

This brings me to my belief of the god - **the power**. 
According to me, the power is a **mathematical function** with some parameters which largely controls the world in a **probabilistic way** and 
its **sole purpose** is to **form** a **universe**, **govern** it, and **end** it years later. That’s it. I do not believe that it somehow favours
**individual good**. That means there were **infinite possibilities** of formation of the **universes** and ours is just one (the one which is 3-3.5
standard deviations away from the most probable one). The sole motive of the power is to let these events proceed as they should and
make **infinite possibilities** so as to fulfil the power’s **mathematical requirements**, which according to me, is to **favour** the **formation**
of **infinitely many universes** each with different characteristics. The very reason that the power helped the chain of events (which I
mentioned earlier) occur, was to fulfil its requirement to form a universe like ours because if the chain wasn’t supported 1 possibility
(our universe) off infinite others would have been eliminated and hence rendering the equation of the power **unsatisfied mathematically**.
The power is a complex stochastic process of a mathematical system with many parameters which can be unified into one single variable as
the state of the universe. The state of the universe itself is a function of millions maybe billions of parameters like **spacetime
physical parameters** and **non-physical parameters**. The **spacetime physical parameters** may include all the physical properties of the
universe and the particles within like **velocity**, **position**, **spin** etc. The non-physical parameters may include the **energy** and certain
non-physical weird variables which I **cannot** define. One such variable out of millions other, according to me, is the **“actions of living
organisms in the universe”**. No, I am not going against my own argument that individual good or bad actions **don’t matter** to the power.
I am talking about the **collective actions** of elements in **sub-microsystems** of the universe, like planet earth. It works in a way that it
is controlled by **collective good and bad** as defined by the equation (and **not** humans). There is some **weird variable** which captures the 
actions of individuals and **quantifies** them. There is another variable which captures the **weighted average** of the previous variable to 
get the **“collective” action** in a quantified value. This variable is **important** for **the state** of the universe or sub-system of the 
universe. If the collective good or bad value changes, the state of sub-system of the universe changes thereby changing the nature of
the sub-system. One example will be, as the world switches from **collective good to collective bad** as **understood by humans**, the 
sub-system (here planet earth) gets more **chaotic**. And this is **intuitive** right? As the sub-system called earth gets more unjust and
evil, chaos arrives to **shift** the system back to the collective good. I do not know the time required for this change to happen. 
Maybe it is a millennium but I am sure it will happen sometime. 

I should explain more about **the good** and **bad** here. Good or bad don’t necessarily mean the **traditional good or bad** as the society thinks.
It is a constant set of actions **clearly defined** in our **state variable**. Good and bad itself can be called something else like **0 and 1**
maybe. My point here is universe accepts **two schools of actions** and changes **sub-system nature** according to these. Human definition of
good and bad keeps **changing** and it in **no way** changes the state variable. For example, there was a time when it was considered good for
women to stay at homes and serve the family, however it is not the case now. Same-sex love was frowned upon and was “bad” 30 years ago
(even today for some). Hence human definitions of good/bad will change. The day we **arrive at** the state variable definition of good/bad or 0/1 we
will be able to control the sub-system conditions thereby making us **super-powerful**. But until then mankind has to keep on evolving and
try to approach the **“universe” definition** of good and bad. In the process, there will be **injustice**, **murders**, **hatred**, etc and sadly the
power won’t do a thing about it as it only sees the **collective good/bad or 0/1** variable wherein good/bad or 0/1 itself is defined
according to the power. 



# “Hey, this is stupid!” - Final words

---

I know this might be the first reaction of people who read the arguments I put forth. Even if not, a lot of readers might have thought
that this is **highly unlikely**. I can understand, however to them this is my argument. 

The fact that there is a law that governs attraction between bodies would have been **stupid** before **1687**. Newtonian gravitation is a 
function of the product of masses and inverse square of the distance between bodies. This definitely might have been difficult for
people to accept at that time. The fact that space and time are **intertwined** into a single quantity called **spacetime** baffles many 
people even today. The fact that time is **dependant** upon the **mass** of object nearby or the **velocity of the frame** was definitely difficult
to digest in the 20th century. The fact that **quantum objects** are actually **waves** is still hard to **comprehend** for me. My point is complex 
**mathematical ideas** were difficult to digest when they were **first proposed**. 

Only time (as large as million human years) will tell what exactly god is. But I have a **firm belief** in my theory. This is my **theory of
the power**.
